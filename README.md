# Wireless_Heater
A wireless temperature sensor to send temperature.

Project is based on PIC18F4550 ÂµC but working on all PIC18 family 

The main goal is to provide remote temperature sensors and  a receiver.

The board in /CAD is a simple board build around the pic18f2550 from Microchip

The link is done by using a NRF24L01+ to avoid wireless problems ( e.g. : 433Mhz )
The sensor is a DS18B20 with dallas 1-Wire protocol ( very cheap sensor )
